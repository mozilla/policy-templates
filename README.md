# Firefox Policy Templates

> [!NOTE]
> These policies are in active development and may contain changes that do not work with current versions of Firefox.
> Use the [officially released versions](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases) if you are deploying changes.

This repository contains policy templates to support deploying and managing Firefox as an enterprise browser.

Firefox policies allow administrators to centrally manage browser behavior, enforce security requirements, configure features, or disable certain functionality.
Policies are commonly used in enterprise or managed environments such as businesses, schools, and public-sector organizations.

## Policy documentation

Documentation for policy behavior and syntax is moving to [Firefox Admin Docs](https://firefox-admin-docs.mozilla.org/reference/policies/).
The new docs repository is public and open to contributions, so if you want to make improvements, feel free to contribute at https://github.com/mozilla/enterprise-admin-reference.
See the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/discussions/1291) for more information.
