# Policy templates for Firefox

> [!NOTE]
> These policies are in active development and may contain changes that do not work with current versions of Firefox.
>
> Use the [officially released versions](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases) if you are deploying changes.

The [policy reference](https://mozilla.github.io/policy-templates/) contains documentation for each policy, its intended function, the settings you can adjust, examples of valid configurations, and any platform limitations that may apply.

## About policies

Firefox policies allow administrators to centrally manage browser behavior, enforce security requirements, configure features, or disable certain functionality.

Policies are commonly used in managed environments such as businesses, schools, and public-sector organizations.
They can be deployed using platform-specific mechanisms, including Group Policy on Windows, configuration profiles on macOS, and JSON configuration files on all platforms.

This repository contains policy templates to support deploying and managing Firefox as an enterprise browser.
